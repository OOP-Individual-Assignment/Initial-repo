# Initial-repo
This is the individual assignment due on Wednesday 28th 2026 Mid-night


In this assignment, you will create a Person Management System that demonstrates all the OOP concepts we learned in class:
Encapsulation (private variables, getters/setters)
Inheritance (parent and child classes)
Abstraction (abstract class and methods)
Polymorphism (method overriding)
Interface (contract that classes must follow)
Constructors (to initialize objects)
Method Overloading (same name, different parameters)
